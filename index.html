    <p class="paragraph">Lorem Ipsum is <span class="invisible">dummy text </span> of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when<span class="blue"> an unknown printer took</span> a galley of type and scrambled it to make
        a type specimen book. It has <span class="invisible"> not only </span>five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining <span class="red">essentially</span> unchanged. It <span class="pop"> popularised</span> in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum<span class="page"> passages,</span> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
